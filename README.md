This is a very simple and fundamental code that takes the imdb reviews of a movie (or a title on imdb), scrapes it, and builds a simple and basic wordcloud out of it.
Made for fun and practice purposes.
Install requirements.txt file for dependencies.
Sample imdb review link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
When the code is run, it would ask you to input the url. The above sample belongs to 'The shawshank Redemption', but you may use your desired movie review page on imdb.

How To Get The Link:
Bascially, you go to a movie title on imdb, click on 'User Reviews', which would navigate you to reviews given by all users. This information is being taken to build the wordcloud.
