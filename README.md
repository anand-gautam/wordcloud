This is a very simple and fundamental code that takes the imdb reviews of a movie (or a title on imdb), scrapes it, and builds a simple and basic wordcloud out of it.
Made for fun and practice purposes.
Install requirements.txt file for dependencies.
Sample imdb review link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/reviews?ref_=tt_urv

Bascially, you go to a movie title on imdb, click on 'User Reviews', which would navigate you to reviews given by all users. This information is being taken to build the wordcloud.
